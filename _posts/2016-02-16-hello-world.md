Hi!

This is the Clippings engineering and design blog
where we would share our thoughts.

We would mainly write about:

- our open-source projects
- tips and tricks we are using
- behind the scenes stories on how we have achieved something
- the processes we use
- team members
- hiring

Expect a lot of posts about open-source, development workflow, continious
integration, our culture and much more!
