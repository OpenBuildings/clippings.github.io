We are always looking for new teams members to join our team of developers and help us with our growth. If you are a developer looking for new challenges, please read along.

## Why Clippings.com?

Here are a few reasons why you would want to join our team:

### Mission and values

Our mission is to redesign the furniture design industry. This sounds quite bold as most of the industry is operating offline and quite slow to change, but we see this as an opportunity.

We are fulfilling our vision by creating a platform to directly connect design brands and individual designers with their end customers - architects, interior designers and design-conscious consumers. We skip the chain of retailers, distributors and dealers. By empowering designers we support moving the industry further.

We are a small startup, but aim high and grow quickly. We've [recently raised Â£850k via a crowdfunding campaign among the design community](https://www.crowdcube.com/clippings) to help us with our mission to redesign the design industry.

Read [more about Clippings and our philosophy](https://clippings.com/about).

### The team

You would be working with highly-engaged team of developers. We always try to learn new technologies, incorporate the latest best practices and try new things.

We realise everybody has their strong and weak sides and we would help you learn in various fields - from improving communication with others to latest terminal hacks.

### Our process

We are a small, but effective team working with tools and techniques like continuous integration, automated unit tests, Scrum and code reviews. The developers are really close to the product decisions working directly with the CEO and the creative director to plan our work.

We open-source a lot of our work and we try to help the community. We already have some popular packages and we've supported some projects related to Postmark, Algolia, MailChimp, Guzzle, OmniPay and more. You could see some of our open-source repositories at [https://github.com/clippings](https://github.com/clippings) and [https://github.com/openbuildings](https://github.com/openbuildings).

## What kind of people we are looking for?

We are looking for passionate developers with experience in full-stack web programming. Technologies and frameworks are always changing so if you are experienced enough, you would know your current stack does not matter so much as adaptability.

We want people who are agile, initiative, always looking to grow and try new stuff.

We work a lot with PHP and JavaScript at the moment, but we also have sprinkles of Python, Ruby, Bash and others. You are welcome to change our stack if you have good arguments and it fits the business needs.

We are based in [Sofia, Bulgaria](https://goo.gl/maps/MPu3nmG6AbB2) and [London, UK](https://goo.gl/maps/Yxva2nBHsXq). All of the developers are in Bulgaria and we are mostly looking for people located there even working remotely, but we would consider every candidate.

## How to apply?

Shoot us an email at [jobs@clippings.com](mailto:jobs@clippings.com?subject=Working+at+Clippings.com). Don't forget to tell us a bit about yourself and send us some of your projects. Ideally you could send us links to your GitHub, StackOverflow, LinkedIn and other relevant profiles.

Here are a couple of challenges we've prepared which you could try to do yourself, publish as your own open-source repositories and send them to us for review and feedback:

  - [Algolia.com CLI client as a npm package](https://github.com/clippings/challenge-algolia)
  - [Swift Mailer plugin in PHP as a Composer package](https://github.com/clippings/challenge-1)
